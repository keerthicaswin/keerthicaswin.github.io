## 🧬 About Me

I’m a PhD scholar passionate about decoding how viruses outsmart treatment through unique proofreading mechanisms. My research explores the molecular workings of viral exonucleases to inspire next-generation antiviral strategies. I blend biochemistry, biophysics, RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, and piRNA mapping to bridge fundamental biology and therapeutic innovation.

## 🔬 Research Projects

### 🦠 Coronavirus Proofreading Mechanism

Why do many antivirals fail against coronaviruses? During the COVID-19 pandemic, I became fascinated by this question. I discovered that coronaviruses possess a special enzyme—a proofreading exonuclease—that detects and removes antiviral drugs, allowing them to preserve their genetic code. My research deciphers this mechanism at the molecular level to design better therapies. This project was a deviation from my lab's core focus on neural crest lineage and melanocyte fate—but thanks to the support of my curious PI, it became a reality.

### 🎨 Vitiligo and Mitochondrial Health

Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder where melanocytes are selectively destroyed. While immune pathways are well studied, the root cause of melanocyte loss remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests mitochondrial dysfunction may play a pivotal role. In our study, we identified a key enzyme that maintains mitochondrial health during melanogenesis. Its downregulation in vitiligo may impair mitochondrial function, triggering melanocyte destruction and advancing disease progression.
